# CHAOS GAME FRACTALS GENERATOR

The programs here are not interactive, you have to manually change the initial parameters to generate the fractals.
My favourite it's the **common-lisp--opticl** one.


##common-lisp--opticl: (sbcl, quicklisp, opticl)

The chaos-game.sh file, execute directly chaos-game.lisp with sbcl and save the generated fractal with the chaos game itself in chaos.png.


##common-lisp--sdl2: (sbcl, quicklisp, sdl2)

Just load the chaos-game.lisp to run.


##clojure--quil: (clojure, leinengen, quil)

To execute the code, use leinengen: *$ lein run*.
The code it's much slower than the common-lisp one.
